#### June 10, 2020

### Description

_This application serves as an introduction to building an API with C#/.NET Core. It expands on the [Pupper API](https://github.com/LonleyBuzzyBee/pupper.git) created by Mai Cook and Eric Settels with an MVC application._

### Instructions for use:
1. Open Terminal (macOS) or PowerShell (Windows)
2. To download the API project Directory to your desktop enter the following commands:
```
cd Desktop
git clone https://github.com/LonleyBuzzyBee/pupper.git
cd pupper (or the file name you created for the main Directory of the download)
```
3. To view the downloaded files, open them in a text editor or IDE of your choice.
* if you have VSCode for example, when your terminal is within the main project Directory you can open all of the files with the command:
```
code .
```
<!-- appsettings.json is not in gitignore for API -->
<!-- 4. Create a file within the Pupper folder named appsettings.json.
5. Add the following code:
```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=pupper_;uid=root;pwd=YOURMYSQLPASSWORDHERE;"
  }
}
```
* Add your MySQL password and make any other changes needed if you have an alternative server, port, or uid selected. These are the default settings. -->
4. To download the MVC project Directory to your desktop enter the following commands:
```
cd Desktop
git clone https://github.com/jhvozdovich/pupper-mvc.git
cd pupper-mvc (or the file name you created for the main Directory of the download)
```
5. To view the downloaded files, open them in a text editor or IDE of your choice.
* if you have VSCode for example, when your terminal is within the main project Directory you can open all of the files with the command:
```
code .
```


#### If you need to install and configure MySQL:
1. Download the MySQL Community Server DMG file [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484914) with the "No thanks, just start my download" link.
2. On the configuration page of the installer select the following options:
* Use legacy password encryption
* Set your password
3. Open the terminal and enter the command:
*'export PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
4. Download the MySQL Workbench DMG file [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484391)
5. Open Local Instance 3306 with the password you set.

#### To create a local version of the database:
1. Open a terminal within your code editor.
2. Within the open API directory, navigate to the Pupper folder with the following command:
```
cd Pupper
```
3. Run the following command to recreate the project's database structure:
```
dotnet ef database update
```
4. Verify that the database structure is present by refreshing the MySQL workbench schemas. There should now be a directory for pupper_.
5. To run the database on your local host, run the following commands:
```
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

#### To run the MVC program:
To install the necessary dependencies and start a localhost, after replicating the database and ensuring it is also running on a different session (Example: API on port 5000, MVC on port 5006), run the following commands:
```
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run
```
